You can examine some good games developed by Javascript.

I used website of https://www.freecodecamp.org to build these projects.

In projects there are HTML, CSS, Javascript files and some images.

Enjoy the games.

### 01. Rock Paper Scissors Game
Rock paper scissors game, which is a very popular game, is included in this project.

The user must click on the picture to make choice.

After the user clicks on the picture, the computer makes its own choice.

The preferences made by the user and the computer are shown on the screen.

The scores of the user and the computer are shown on the scoreboard.

The first to reach 10 wins the game.

When the number 10 is reached, the user's winning or losing is shown on the screen.

The game starts again 2 seconds after the number 10 is reached.

### 02. Simon Game
Before starting the game, you have to click the power button.

Then you can start the game by clicking the start button.

The total number of rounds in the game is 20.

In each round, the color is flashing as much as the number of the round you are in.

After the flashing of the colors is completed, it is the turn of the user.

The user must click on the correct colors in order to know the colors that the computer is flashing.

Here, if strict mode is on and the user clicks on the wrong color, the game starts from the beginning.

However, if strict mode is not turned on, when you click on the wrong color, it starts again from the current round.

When the user reaches the end of 20 rounds correctly, the user wins the game.
