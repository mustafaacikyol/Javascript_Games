You can examine some good games developed by Javascript.

I used website of https://www.freecodecamp.org to build these projects.

In projects there are HTML, CSS, Javascript files and some images.

Enjoy the games.

### 01. Rock Paper Scissors Game
Rock paper scissors game, which is a very popular game, is included in this project.

The user must click on the picture to make choice.

After the user clicks on the picture, the computer makes its own choice.

The preferences made by the user and the computer are shown on the screen.

The scores of the user and the computer are shown on the scoreboard.

The first to reach 10 wins the game.

When the number 10 is reached, the user's winning or losing is shown on the screen.

The game starts again 2 seconds after the number 10 is reached.

### 02. Simon Game
Before starting the game, you have to click the power button.

Then you can start the game by clicking the start button.

The total number of rounds in the game is 20.

In each round, the color is flashing as much as the number of the round you are in.

After the flashing of the colors is completed, it is the turn of the user.

The user must click on the correct colors in order to know the colors that the computer is flashing.

Here, if strict mode is on and the user clicks on the wrong color, the game starts from the beginning.

However, if strict mode is not turned on, when you click on the wrong color, it starts again from the current round.

When the user reaches the end of 20 rounds correctly, the user wins the game.

### 03. Doodle Jump Game
When the game starts, the doodler jumps up.

When the doodler's height from the ground exceeds 200px, the platform slides down.

When the height of the doodler from the ground exceeds 350px, the doodler goes down.

If the doodler comes across any of the platforms during the fall, it jumps up again. When the doodler reaches a height of 200px from the jumping platform, it falls again.

Right, left and up keys are used on the keyboard to control the doodler.

While the doodler is moving to the right or left, when the up key is pressed, the doodler goes straight.

In order to be successful in the game, while the doodler is going down, it is to make it come to any of the platforms with the arrow keys on the keyboard and go up again.

The game is over when the Doodler touches the ground.

When the game is over, it is written on the screen that the game is over and the score obtained.

If the user wants to play again, user can click the restart button and start the game.

### 04. Flappy Bird Game
There is a 3 second countdown timer at the start of the game.

After 3 seconds, the game starts.

With the start of the game, the bird falls down.

The space key should be pressed for the bird to go up.

If the bird falls to the ground, the game is over.

The bird has to pass through the obstacles in front of it.

If the bird hits one of the obstacles, the game is over.

When the game is over, the game is over and the score is shown on the screen.

To start the game again, the restart game button should be clicked.
